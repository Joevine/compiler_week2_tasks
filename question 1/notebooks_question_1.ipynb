It then iterates through each row in the list, stripping out any leading and trailing whitespace using the defined strip() method.\n# For each line, it uses the startswith() method to check if it starts with the \"#\" character, which represents a comment.\n# If a line starts with a \"#\" symbol or character, it is classified as a comment, if not, it is classified as code.\n# The results are stored in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row and its classification.\n\n# ii. \n# Lexical analysis usually involves breaking the source code into tokens (e.g. keywords, identifiers, operators), but these are not required for this task.\n# Syntax analysis involves checking the structure and correctness of the code, which is not necessary here either.\n# For the above case, we use basic string manipulation (startswith()) method and string classification to determine whether a line is a comment or code. We do not analyze the context of the code or its meaning.\n\n\n",
